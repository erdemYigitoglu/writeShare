	<h1>about the project</h1>
	<p>
		I love google docx. I want to access all of my documents from everywhere. More importantly I love to cooperate with other people on my documents. I hate that google docx is although accessible not practical for blind users. Furthermore I find sencronizing documents in my computer and google docx tedious and difficult.   
	</p>
	<p>
		I want to create an application that is: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>accessible and practical for as many users as possible,</li>
		<li>lightweight</li>
		<li>easily sencronizable with multiple devices</li>
	</ul>
